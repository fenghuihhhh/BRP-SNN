# BRP-SNN
A Brain-Inspired Robot Pain Model Based on a Spiking Neural Network

Our BRP-SNN is running in real time on the Nao robot platform. In order to make it easier for users to understand, we have designed and uploaded a new version. This version contains all the details of the BRP-SNN and the robot data we have collected, so that users can run and debug it without any robot or virtual environment.
