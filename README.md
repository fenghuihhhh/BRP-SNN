# BRP-SNN
A Brain-Inspired Robot Pain Model Based on a Spiking Neural Network

Our BRP-SNN is running in real time on the Nao robot platform. In order to make it easier for users to understand, we have designed and uploaded a new version. This version contains all the details of the BRP-SNN and the robot data we have collected, so that users can run and debug it without any robot or virtual environment.(If you have questions about the details of the implementation of the robot platform, you can contact me at any time.)
